# smeshapp

Flutter project built for the purpose of SUTD 30.111 Entrepreneurship module.

My group worked on an idea, "Smesh" which stood in short for "Seamless Mesh", the aim was to improve networking methods by making use of NFC technology embedded in digital business cards, at the same time also striving to help individuals capture more value and meaning from their networking with a few key features. On top of that, we want to make social/professional events easy to find and easy to register for anyone starting out their networking journey.
